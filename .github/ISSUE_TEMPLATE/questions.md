Don't use issues to ask questions.
First of all visit our [help page](https://smartcookieweb.com/help) (this can solve several of your doubts about SmartCookieWeb), but if you still have any questions, want to say something, give feedback, etc. you can start a new discussion in the [discussion section](https://github.com/CookieJarApps/SmartCookieWeb/discussions), enter the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/scwgroup) or enter the [Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#smartcookieweb:matrix.org).

STOP!!! STOP!!! STOP!!!
