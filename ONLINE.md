Some SmartCookieWeb features use online services. Below, the data collected and used by these is detailed.

# Translation

The Reading Mode translator uses Microsoft Translate. The app sends the entire Reading Mode page to a server operated by CookieJarApps.

Each sentence from the page is seperated and sent individually to Microsoft for translation, mixed in with other user's queries.

Each sentence and its translation is then stored in a database for 14 days for a quicker translation if the same page is translated again.

Sentences can't be linked to a user and are not shared with any 3rd parties. No IP addresses are stored.


# Search Suggestions

SmartCookieWeb offers a custom search suggestion system (disabled by default). Queries made to the server for suggestions and IP addresses are not stored.

No data about searches or queries entered into the search field are stored anywhere.
